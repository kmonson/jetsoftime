--ABOUT--

Jets of Time is a remake of Wings of Time, intended to create faster seeds while taking more liberties with the gameplay. The progression has been altered greatly, and seeds can usually be beat within the 2:30:00 mark. The gameplay is *still* mostly classic Chrono Trigger, so being good at the base game helps a lot.

This fork is intended to clean up the JoT repo and update much of the code and the project to be more pythonic.

--USAGE--

Will update with new usage instructions as they become available.
